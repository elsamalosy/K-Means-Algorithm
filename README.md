This code performs K-Means clustering on a dataset of Mall Customers to group them into clusters based on their annual income and spending score. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what each part of the code does:

1. **Import Libraries:** It starts by importing the necessary Python libraries, including NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for data visualization, Pandas for data handling, and scikit-learn's KMeans for clustering.

2. **Load the Dataset:** It reads the Mall Customers dataset from a CSV file ('Mall_Customers.csv') and extracts the relevant columns, which are annual income and spending score, and stores this data in the variable `X`.

3. **Determine Optimal Number of Clusters (Elbow Method):** It uses the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters for K-Means. The code iterates through a range of cluster numbers (from 1 to 10), fits a K-Means model for each cluster number, and calculates the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for each model. WCSS measures the variance within each cluster, and the elbow method looks for the "elbow point" in the plot of WCSS values to determine the optimal number of clusters. This part of the code generates a plot showing the WCSS values for different cluster numbers.

4. **Plot the Elbow Method Results:** It plots the WCSS values against the number of clusters to help visually identify the elbow point.

5. **Train K-Means with Optimal Number of Clusters:** After determining the optimal number of clusters (in this case, 5), it initializes a K-Means model with this number and fits it to the dataset. This model is stored in the `kmeans` variable.

6. **Visualize the Clusters:** It visualizes the resulting clusters by creating a scatter plot. Each data point is plotted with a color corresponding to its assigned cluster. The centroids of the clusters are also plotted as yellow points. This visualization helps you understand how the customers are grouped based on their annual income and spending score.

In summary, this code reads a dataset of Mall Customers, uses the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, and then performs K-Means clustering to group customers into clusters based on their income and spending behavior. The final visualization shows how these clusters are distributed in the data space.
